Code for Kaggle whale recognition challenge.

- `Lasagne Classifier.ipynb`

  Conversion of Anil's code to Lasagne, adds zoom and gamma data augmentation. Requires merging https://github.com/f0k/Lasagne/tree/batchnorm

- `Lasagne Classifier - Tweaked.ipynb`

  Lasagne classifier with some network architecture changes. Seems to train faster and possibly a little better.

- `testpoints` 
  
   Bonnet/Blowhole annotation files for the test images
